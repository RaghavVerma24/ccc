### Algorithms

#### Binary search

-   https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-science/algorithms/binary-search/a/binary-search

1. Let min = 1 max = n.
2. Guess the average of max and min, rounded down so that it is an integer.
3. If you guessed the number, stop. You found it!
4. If the guess was too low, set min to be one larger than the guess.
5. If the guess was too high, set max to be one smaller than the guess.
6. Go back to step two.

#### Selection sort

-   https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-science/algorithms/sorting-algorithms/a/selection-sort-pseudocode

1. Find the smallest card. Swap it with the first card.
2. Find the second-smallest card. Swap it with the second card.
3. Find the third-smallest card. Swap it with the third card.
4. Repeat finding the next-smallest card, and swapping it into the correct position until the array is sorted.

#### Insertion sort

-   https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-science/algorithms/insertion-sort/a/insertion-sort-pseudocode

1. Call insert to insert the element that starts at index 1 into the sorted subarray in index 0.
2. Call insert to insert the element that starts at index 2 into the sorted subarray in indices 0 through 1.
3. Call insert to insert the element that starts at index 3 into the sorted subarray in indices 0 through 2.
4. …
5. Finally, call insert to insert the element that starts at index n-1n−1n, minus, 1 into the sorted subarray in indices 0 through n-2n−2n, minus, 2.

#### Mergesort

-   https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-science/algorithms/merge-sort/a/divide-and-conquer-algorithms

1. Divide by finding the number q of the position midway between p and r. Do this step the same way we found the midpoint in binary search: add p and r, divide by 2, and round down.
2. Conquer by recursively sorting the subarrays in each of the two subproblems created by the divide step. That is, recursively sort the subarray array[p..q] and recursively sort the subarray array[q+1..r].
3. Combine by merging the two sorted subarrays back into the single sorted subarray array[p..r].

-   https://github.com/TSiege/Tech-Interview-Cheat-Sheet#merge-sort

#### Quicksort

1. Divides entire dataset in half by selecting the middle element and putting all smaller elements to the left of the element and larger ones to the right.
2. It repeats this process on the left side until it is comparing only two elements at which point the left side is sorted.
3. When the left side is finished sorting it performs the same operation on the right side.
